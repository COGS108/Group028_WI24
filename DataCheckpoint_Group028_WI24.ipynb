In addition, we want to treat revenue as a secondary outcome variable, and see how each factor listed earlier correlates with a film's revenue.

    "The film industry has grown to one of the most competitive and expensive industries. Being one of the most influential forms of entertainment, studios compete against each other by making intentional choices and investing money in certain films, hoping for great returns from critics and audiences. Many large tech companies like Apple and Amazon pivoting toward the film industry to capitalize on successful movies to drive their comercial revenue, highlighting the power that films have as a source of profit for studios and companies. Thus, we are interested in seeing what kinds of movies are most favorable with audiences.This brings up the significance of movie ratings: IMDB, one of the largest and most popular movie databases, allows users to rate movies on a scale from 1-10. Due to its large number of users, IMDB's user ratings act as a relatively representative and direct metric for an audience's opinions on a film. In the paper “A Predictor for Movie Success”<a name=\"cite_ref-1\"></a>[<sup>1</sup>](#cite_note-1), Ericson and Grodman proposed using machine learning to determine the relationships between sets of metrics about a film, and the film’s critics scores, audience scores, US gross revenue, open weekend gross revenue, and film’s IMDB rating. These sets of metrics contain the factors that we are interested in studying, among others. One of these models highlighted the audience score as the best predictor for a film’s success among all factors. This confirms our belief that there is a correlation between the features that we selected, with audience ratings.\n",
    "\n",
    "Although the film industry is highly competitive, it has been seen several times that indie movies with low budgets from unknown studios can defy expectations with high revenue and ratings. In another study by Max Wasserman et al<a name=\"cite_ref-2\"></a>[<sup>2</sup>](#cite_note-2), they pointed out the historical changes in correlation between movie budget and user ratings. Their results show a strong positive correlation between a film's budget and user ratings overall. However, the rise of independent distribution companies like A24 and Neon in recent years have made the earning potential for low-budget films higher than they have been historically. This suggests that the relationship between a film's budget and its user rating on IMDB may be more complicated than we initially thought. We hope to further investigate this relationship in our project.\n",
    "\n",
    "With bigger budgets, movie studios and directors would concievably have more flexibility in choosing their film’s genre choices, runtime, release date, and even content, targeting specific MPA ratings to appeal to audiences with a certain level of maturity. All of these factors have their own advantages and tradeoffs for user ratings. In a paper by Pedro Garcia-del-Barrio and Hugo Zarco<a name=\"cite_ref-3\"></a>[<sup>3</sup>](#cite_note-3), they analyzed the influence of a film’s contents with its box office revenue. They included factors such as genre, mature content, and release season in their analysis. Their results showed a significant influence for all of those factors with box office revenue across 4 models. Furthermore, they also showed that certain genres of film have more significance than others, supporting our initial idea in our research question that certain types of films may systematically perform better than others. Although this paper didn’t cover user ratings, “A Predictor for Movie Success”<a name=\"cite_ref-1\"></a>[<sup>1</sup>](#cite_note-1) points out the positive correlation between a movie’s revenue and its user ratings. This suggests that the relationships we see between a film's characteristics and its revenue may also hold true for its user ratings, and vice versa. Hence, we hope to see the influence of genre, release date, and mature content (associated with a higher MPA Rating) translated into user ratings in our analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "While a film’s rating is a direct metric to measure the audience’s satisfaction, a profitable movie does not always make it highly rated, and vice versa. However, from the studio’s perspective, a lucrative film is a success. As such, we are also interested in seeing how the prior factors correlate to a film’s overall revenue.\n",

    "We predict that of all of our listed factors, the budget and MPA rating of a film will be most strongly correlated with the IMDB average audience rating, with higher budgets and “R” ratings correlating with higher audience ratings. We predict that longer runtimes, being a drama, and being released during the summer will also correlate with a higher average rating on IMDB, since we imagine longer dramas released during summer blockbuster season are more likely to perform well with critics. Similarly, we expect the correlation of each factor will remain the same when put against revenue. In addition, we predict that revenue has a positive correlation with the average user ratings."

    "## Data overview\n",
    "\n",
    "For our ideal dataset, we would need information on several metrics regarding films pulled from IMDB’s movie database. We would need the film’s average user rating, the runtime of the film, its budget (in USD), its total box office revenue (in USD), release month, genre, and MPA rating (G, PG, PG-13, R, etc). We should note that our monetary metrics (budget and revenue) should all be adjusted for inflation to make for a valid comparison. Previous sources have mentioned the difficulty of scraping data from IMDB due to its inconsistent data entry formats (data is stored in text documents, not in tables or .csv files). If possible, we hope to avoid scraping this data directly from IMDB and will instead seek out recent existing databases that contain information from IMDB. We will also be limiting our dataset to only include movies, although IMDB also includes television series in its database. There are numerous datasets from IMDB available on Kaggle. One of which, called \"Movie Industry,\" contains all the necessary variables we would be analyzing. This dataset only includes information on films as recent as 2020, but for the purposes of this analysis, we feel that this time range should provide more than enough observations to see if any preliminary correlations exist.\n"

    "- \"name\" : gives the movie name as a string.\n",

A film’s revenue and information about its characteristics are all publicly available and impersonal information, and the IMDB average rating for a film is a mean taken from several anonymous individual reviewers, meaning our variables of interest are all ethically sourced. Our datasets will likely mostly be taken from Kaggle, which hosts publicly available data, and we plan to take full responsibility for the ethical implications of our results. \n",

While we are accessing user’s ratings of a film on IMDB, we have no access to user’s personal information, and are instead pulling an average rating from the scores of countless users, meaning the privacy of IMDB users is protected. We are committed to analyzing our data and interpreting our results in an objective and unbiased manner, and will strive to avoid misrepresenting our results or engaging in any faulty analytical practices (p-hacking, etc.). By choosing our data carefully and dedicating ourselves to fair research practices, we hope to maintain ethics and privacy in our project."

We will divide up the work on each phase of the project as it comes to make sure that nobody takes on more work than is necessary, and we expect that all team members will communicate early if they have other responsibilities or anything urgent comes up."
