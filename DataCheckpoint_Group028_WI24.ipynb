In addition, we want to use revenue as a secondary baseline to understand the significance of the characteristics.

    "Movies are one of the oldest and most influential forms of entertainment. As shown throughout history, movies have pushed technology advancement over and over again. Today, the cinema industry has grown to one of the most competitive and expensive industries. Many corporations from all scales rely on successful movies to drive their comercial revenue. Thus, bringing up the significance of movie ratings. A secondary dependent variable we would like to consider as well is the revenue of a film. A profitable movie does not always make it a critical hit, and vice versa. However, from the studio’s perspective, a lucrative film is a success. As such, we are also interested in seeing how the prior factors correlate to a film’s overall revenue.\n",

On the other hand, many movies from big corporations have historically been crowned as the biggest flops in both critics and audience ratings, despite having triple or quadruple budgets<a name=\"cite_ref-2\"></a>[<sup>2</sup>](#cite_note-2). Despite the outliers, as shown in “A predictor for movie success”<a name=\"cite_ref-3\"></a>[<sup>3</sup>](#cite_note-3), the budget has been pretty consistent with the movie’s revenue which could indicate that their ratings could be positively correlated.\n",

Meanwhile, shorter movies limited the movies’ content and how it is delivered. All of which could impact the movie ratings. Finally, due to the long history of movies, some would regard movies as a medium of cultural exchange. It isn’t surprising that movie studios make very intentional choices when it comes to the genre of the story and the maturity of the content in the movie, as they all have different audiences, standards, and competition. Furthermore, we found a prior study about the release date’s impact on the ratings<a name=\"cite_ref-1\"></a>[<sup>1</sup>](#cite_note-1). Although they didn’t directly show any significance of release date in correlation with ratings, it is also traditional for movies with certain content to be released on a certain date such as October having the highest number of horror movie releases<a name=\"cite_ref-5\"></a>[<sup>5</sup>](#cite_note-5).\n",

    "We predict that of all of our listed factors, the budget and MPA rating of a film will be most strongly correlated with the IMDB average audience rating, with higher budgets and “R” ratings correlating with higher audience ratings. We predict that longer runtimes, being a drama, and being released during the summer will also correlate with a higher average rating on IMDB, since we imagine longer dramas released during summer blockbuster season are more likely to perform well with critics. Similarly, we expect the correlation of each factor will remain the same when put against revenue. In addition, we predict that revenue has a positive correlation with the average user ratings."
